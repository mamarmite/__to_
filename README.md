This project started as regroupment of element I have to_ Do, See, Code, Listen, Read, etc. 
I like to group my bookmarks that way when I wander on the Internet. I decide to pursue my learning of Python by doing this console app tool helping me archive my wanders and generating beautiful simple texte file with them.
